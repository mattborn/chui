# chui
Chui is a framework &amp; methodology for applying persistent DOM hacks to any website.

## Big challenges

- [ ] Safely inject new dependencies like jQuery, Moment, Firebase, etc.
- [ ] Consistently inject markup, scripts, and styles containing entirely new screens and workflows
- [ ] Author cross-domain, event-driven, state-aware helper functions that make sense and save time
- [ ] Gracefully degrade when inevitable code drift occurs (the target site gets updated)
- [ ] Support browser-agnostic bookmarklets for an on-demand experience
- [ ] Support browser-specific extensions for a set-and-forget experience

## About the name

Pronounced **“Chewie”** like the Wookiee.

Inspired by the `chmod` Unix command, but instead of _“change mode”_ it’s _“change UI.”_
